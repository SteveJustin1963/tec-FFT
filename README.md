# tec-FFT
 
Tec-FFT stands for "Time-Encoded Compression Fast Fourier Transform." It is a signal processing technique that combines time encoding and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to efficiently analyze and display signals.

## the process

1. Input to ADC: The signal is first fed into an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), which converts the continuous analog signal into discrete digital samples. The ADC samples the signal at regular intervals and quantizes the amplitude values into integer values.

2. Convert to Integers: The digital samples obtained from the ADC are typically represented as binary values. In this step, these binary values are converted to integer format to facilitate further processing.

3. DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform): The DFT is a mathematical algorithm that transforms a discrete signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. It decomposes the signal into its constituent frequencies. The DFT calculates the amplitude and phase information of each frequency component present in the signal.

4. Convert to Spectrum: Once the DFT is performed, the resulting complex values (consisting of amplitude and phase) are further processed to obtain the spectrum. The spectrum represents the magnitude of each frequency component in the signal. This can be achieved by calculating the absolute value or magnitude of the complex values obtained from the DFT.

5. Display on LCD or 8x8: The final step involves visualizing the spectrum on an LCD screen or an 8x8 display. This can be achieved by mapping the amplitude values of the spectrum to the corresponding pixels on the display. Higher amplitudes can be represented by brighter or larger pixels, while lower amplitudes can be represented by dimmer or smaller pixels.

The Tec-FFT technique combines the advantages of time encoding, which efficiently encodes the temporal information of the signal, with the speed and accuracy of the FFT algorithm to perform real-time spectrum analysis and visualization.
