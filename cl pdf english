SUMMARY:

The spectrum analyzer by FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) obtains the spectrum of a periodic signal through software, 
from 256 sampled points. The input signal must be in the range of 1V to 4V. 
The output signal will also be in the range of 1V to 4V. 
The device can be used in conjunction with an oscilloscope. 
Spectrum presentation is on the device screen. It also allows it to be used as oscilloscope memory for up to 2048 points. 
Can be attached to an X-Y plotter.
